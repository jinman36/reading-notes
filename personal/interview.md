  - R - I let my ego drive for longer than I should have. Certain items needed to have higher elevations of clearance to be brought into country. Once we realized that I had missed this date I called in another member of the team to assist and ensure that no more milestones were missed. We re-evaluated the training plan and had to exclude the items ( Mortars, AT munitions) from the training plan that we had set up and adjust.

      - I have been able to use the lessons learned on this several times by ensuring I understand which items are teh critical path to project completion, and which items have less of a lead time to be able to better prioritize what is important to moving a project forward.

  - R - We graduated with the same 24 members that were there when I took over as class commander, we had lost 2 previously.

  - S - I have been working for a major construction company in the Seattle area for a little over 2 years now, while working there I have also been a member of the Washington National Guard, now I am attending a code fellows boot camp. Each of these jobs can have significant time requirements and often without careful coordination the schedule can conflict, potentially at very inconvenient times.
  - T - Ensure that I maintain all deadlines, tasks, and additional requirements of the 3 jobs that I am currently participating in.
  - 
  
  I have adopted the use of 3 digital tools to ensure that I track and meet all required deadlines. The most important tool being Outlook and the Outlook calendar to keep track of my basic timeline to provide de-confliction with key dates, and times. 
      - The second is excel, which is one of the easier methods to share purchase orders and expediting with other members of my office. 
      - The third, is Trello, which I use to record individual goals, deadlines, and track progress throughout the duration of a project.
