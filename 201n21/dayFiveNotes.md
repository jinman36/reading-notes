## Notes
- 'for' loops
- 'if and if/else. loop[]

- things are going to get complicated over the next couple weeks:) which I'm happy about, I like puzzles

wordpress is about 1/3 of webpages on the internet.. creates nice websites with very little work

- CodePen practice with boxes
  - float
  - display: inline-block;
   - line height

  - em - ephemoral unit - this will adjust font size of text

- serif - references to the little feet and arms on the text
- sans-serif

- v-width - viewport width -adjusts to device that you are viewing the site from


## Arrays
- Arrays - an array is a data structure
 - writing a repl.it for class
- a list of values [value 1, value 2, v3, etc]
- a collection of things

- example
- var myFavoriteColors = ['blue', 'green', 'black'];

- var myString = 'string';
-var myNumber = 42;

-var my Array = [myString, myBoolean, myNumber]

- moving to repl.it for additional notes on this!

- While loops run with conditional is true - potentially unlimited (can crash system)
- var user prompt('what is your name?';
- console.log

## Learning Journal
- for the lab we need to remember the data type - it asks for a number do make sure the logic matches data type - I randomly found parseInt() which allows the computer to distinguish between a string or an integer.  

- How did this go, overall? This was a difficult assignment for me. There was a lot of different things to try for question 6 and 7 and the logical opertors did not make a lot of sense in many of the instances used but they seem to be doing what I need, at this time, so I do not want to fight it.

- What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
    - the tip about "break" was good - I kept getting stuck in the loop after I answered the prompt correctly but it would still give me the final error message, as if I had entered everything incorrectly.
  - How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
    - I started looking at it yesterday afternoon and had a fairly good basis for what I was going to do. The additional work we did in class didn't fill in as many of the blanks as I anticipated but some small tips that Ryan gave seemed to be worth their weight in gold once I started digging into the problem.
