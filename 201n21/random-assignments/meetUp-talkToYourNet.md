## Summary
- Topics included:
    - Job hunting
    - Why Choose JS over the other languages
    - What is TypeScript
    - Storing Arrays into local storage
    - Does anybody use JS to build something other than web dev
    - What is your favorite JS open source project to contribute to
    - How to learn testing tools and techniques with JS, specifically for web dev? Learning paths to recommend?
    - How can JavaScript closures be used in a practical context?
    - Introduction to JS hackers, and how to get started
    - Front-end frameworks React vs View vs Angular

- There were good points on each of the topics throughout the meetup. Some important takeaways that I got  was "ensure that you network and network often." This is true in any job search, not a special topic for tech but due to the saturation of the software developer market, this is probably truer than ever.
- Be prepared for practical interviews and for 'loop' interviews which involve multiple people interviewing you in a row.
- Typescript iws just JS with additional descriptions attached to the variables which makes debugging more efficient.
- Local storage is machine dependant and really not used a lot.

    - I believe this would have been a better meet up on a day that wasn't valentines day. It was a little painful at times due to the low members that were present, although it wasn't a bad time I think it would have been different on a day that wasn't a holiday.

    - Other members of the meetup included
        - Billy Hao - Who graduated another coding boot camp and then is currently working as a TA at the University of Washington.
        - Justin Oliver Lee - The host of the meetup was a graduate of another coding boot camp but gave some good information into different tools, such as codewars and hackerank that could be good to become familiar with in the event similar problem sets are used for practical interviews.

## Talk To Your Network
- who you met with - Ben Hampson
- how you are connected to them - We both work at the same company, we have worked together previously on developing fittings and other materials for BIM 360.
- what you learned about that person and their work - He primarily uses C++ with LISP for programming the different parts of AUtodesk, in order to produce the different modeling pieces to enter into the 360 models. It didn't seem that JavScript was a useful language in that world. He did give me several suggestions for other languages that are similar to JS to maybe look at to get more familiar with such as typescript, C#, or more back end focused languages.
- how you can help them - I didn't really see an avenue that what I have learned to his point would come in handy in that position. I'm sure there are other positions that JavaScript and markUp would be more beneficial but this wasn't necessarily the correct position for this.
