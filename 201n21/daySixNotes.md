## Vocabulary

- let / const
  - let - when in doubt 'let' will always work

  - const - constant - cannot be changed (helpful if multiple people are working on code)
    - cannot change it but you can add to an array that is using const
    - adding to arrays with const needs to utilize the same typeOf()


- demonstrate understanding how functions work in JS
  - declarations
  - calls
  -  

  - FUNCTIONS
    - why use functions
    - to do something
    - reusable - saves time
    - DRY - do not repeat yourself/ easier to read
    - more customizable - **single source of truth**
    - can create function libraries
      - commonly used functions

- Global variable
    let user = 'ryan';

    function greetWorld() {
      console.,log('hello')
    }
 
  - greetworld();


 - vocab
  - declaration: when we define the function - the written code that the name and tell function what to do
    - global
 - hes drawing us a picture


- parameter: name - very vague, used when we declare a function
- argument - lucky - specific, used when we call function


- Apps we will look at later
  - cookie app
  - busMal
- missed a bunch -> going to repl

- Pair Programming
  - single body of code on a single computer

## Lab 04 - Pair Programming: More Extensions to About Me
### I was Navigator on: https://github.com/jinman36/about-me/pull/1
### I was Driver on: https://github.com/TJohnson986/about-me/pull/1

- How did the pair programming process go in general?
  - The process went really well. We started with my code which I believe was helpful to the whole process because it was running fairly well and prepared to be wrapped in functions. We used a little extra time to work on q7 in Tyler's code, which needed a little debugging but we were successful with getting it working and applying a function to it.

- Did you learn anything from your partner? If so, what?
  - I did, we used different methods to answer q7 with our code. I used a 'while' loop, and he used a 'for' loop which gave a great glimpse into being able to code out similar problems in different ways.

- What was the most difficult part of the assignment today?
  - Trying to debug while pair programming was an interesting concept and a little difficult not to just start trying things as a driver. He did a really good job of managing me to ensure that we stayed on track while we went through the steps for debugging.

- What was the easiest part of the assignment today?
  - Surprisingly, the pull requests went really smooth. It felt like it would be more involved but just following the steps seemed to make it work perfectly, which makes me nervous for when it doesn't (but that is for another day.)

- Anything else you’d like to share?
  - nope, I think the other questions cover everything I was looking at.

- How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
  - I felt like navigating through my code would go quickly, which was fair and went about as long as I anticipated. I had no litmos for how long my partners code would take but we were able to go all the way through, debug q7 and PR through the assignment in a couple hours.


## Learning Journal
 - Pair programming was an interesting concept. I think it was a practice in patience for both parties to not get ahead of the navigator while driving but we found a good rhythm by the end.
  - The lab was fun, I really enjoy working on functions and loops, although they are still a challenge for me, it feels great when they line up correctly.


  ### Pedagogy Vs Andragogy In eLearning: Can You Tell The Difference?
   - I think the term "adult learner' is a little demeaning, in the sense that it implies that you have a baseline knowledge in what you are meant to be learning and are opinionated about what you learn. This can cause issues, in my opinion, when entering into new careers because it is applying an idea that the learners are going to know what they don't know and be able to adequately apply their resources to the correct points to pick up the important concepts. 
    - I also recognize it is a slippery slope to always start from the basic and work up, it creates a slow moving learning path, which doesn't really fit the stacked learning module.


    - I will agree that the motivations for learning are more profound in adult learners, in America. I'm specifying the US because school has become a right in the US for children and the older you get the harder the walls to education become to break, whether internal or external, so the motivations to succeed become more important as adult learners than they wer when education was freely handed out.


    - These are pretty much stream of conscious thought about the article for reflection. Not necessarily how I'll feel after more deliberate consideration.
