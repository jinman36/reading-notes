Create a terminal bible to help remember the steps and git flow required

- typically we should not be working on our main branches... main is for finished work

- native JavaScript array methods - comes with / built in
- .push(enter things>); -- inserts into the back of the array
- .pop() - does not need argument - removes from the Back of the array
// .shift(); removes an item from the FRONT of an array - note it reassigns ALL of the indexes
// .unshift( enter things); inserts into the FRONT of the array
// .splice(where (index) to start, number of objects to remove, what to end - if anything) - remove and add ANYWHERE in an attay
// this is more complex - play with caution



- how to find area function:

- function areaFinder (w, h) {
-  let product = w * h;
-  console.log(product)
- }

- areaFinder(5, 10);

- argument is always used when called
- parameter is always used when it is declared

## Git flow 
  1. Repo exists
  2. clone it
- Origin is github - remote is my computer

    - create a branch off of our main branch - where we will work
      1. (git checkout -b branchname)
      2. (git push origin branchname) ACP from this branch - Add/ same - Commit/ Same - push/ changes pushing from new branch to main 
      3. this will create the branch in github/ w code
      4. Pull request (PR) - merge --Github
      5. (Git pull origin main) - this is what will synch your github (origin) with your remote(computer)
      6. (git checkout main)

- five features to a branch (6 feature for a stretch)
