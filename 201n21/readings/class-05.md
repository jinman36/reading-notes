## Chapter 5 HTML
 - Figure out how images are going to be stored on the backend. Whether it will be on the local server or in an images fodler.
  - If you have a larger site and it becomes more unruley, further subdivide the images into more folders like logos, buttons, backgrounds, etc.
- ensure that you are using freeware photos or paying for rights to use photos on launched sites - this could pottentially lead to issues if you use photos you do not have the rights too.

- Images are added to an HTML page with an <img> tag, the tag will need a <img src> to operate explaining where the file is located - this can be a relative url, or the path to a child directory folder.

- <alt> tag will allow you to modify the pic in HTML, and title will allow you to add a title to the image.

- placement of the image within the code will affect how it is viewed. 
- Tags that can help placement - using align lft/right within the alt section will dictate which side of the paragraph tags the image lives on the page.
- top/bottom/ middle tags will also help place the image in relation to the paragraph tags in the same area.

    - \- Three Rules for creating images -
    1. Save the image in the right format (typically jpeg)
    1. Save image at the right size
    1. measure images in pixels
