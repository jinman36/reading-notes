## Concepts for layouts
### Building blocks
 - Block level elements - start on a new line
 - Inline elements - flow in between surrounding text

 ### Controlling the Positioning of elements
 - Normal Flow - Every block level appears on a new line
  - position: static
 - relative Position - moves an element to the right, left, top, bottom of where it would have been placed
  - position: relative
 - Absolute positioning - positions the element in relation to its containing element
  - position: absolute
 - Fixed positioning - form of absolute positioning which positions the element in relation to the browser window
  - position: fixed
 - Floating elements - floating elements allows you to take an element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box
  - float: left/right
