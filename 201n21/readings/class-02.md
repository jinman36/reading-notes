### Chapter 2 HTML
- Structural markups -elements that describe both headings and paragrapghs
- Semantic markups - these provide extra informaiton to the text where the markups are placed - italics, bold, quotations, etc..

- line breaks and horizontal rules - <br /> used inside of the paragraph tags, will create seperate lines on the page
    - <hr /> this wil create a page break
### Chapter 10 HTML
- INternal and external CSS work the same - as long as the external CSS is linked correctly.
- internal CSS is generally placed in the <head> element, using <style> elements. If external CSS is used, the script link is generally placed in the <head> instead.
- Selectors are what are used to target differetn tags
- there are many ways to use CSS but identifying the selectors and tags to apply CSS to will dictate the order that it is placed in the file.
    - The way that CSS is read by the computer is cascading - it will read from the top down to the most specific rules to apply to the web page.
### Chapter 2 JS
- Lnaguage: syntax and grammer - Just like a spoken language javaScript has specific language that needs to be used to operate. 
    - While nameing variables there are 6 rules that need to be followed
        1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore - never a number
        1. the name can include letter, dollar sign, or underscores - cannot contain dash(-) or period (.) within a variable name
        1. You cannot use **keywords** or **reserved words**
        1. All variables are case sensitive
        1. Try to be descriptive with the variable names - chose a name that descrips the action of the variable
        1. Camel case is the recognized standard for js
    - Arrays are for using  multiple variables at one time, or handling list type information
- Giving instructions - using variables, arrays, operators, expressions, and opertors are the key building blocks for giving the computer instructions for how to interact with a web page.
### Chapter 4 JS
- Decisions and loops allow website to create different decision chains throughout a website, based on user interaction.
- A wireframe is greate for HTML ajnd CSS but creating a flowchart will allow a designer to map the decision flow of a user throughout the site. - recognizing and calculating desicion statements to make logical flows. 
- logical operators will be used to compare to operands and create a decision
- 3 types of loops
    - for
    - while
    - do...while
