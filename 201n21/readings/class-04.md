## Chapter 4 HTML
- Links are important -created using an <a> tag 

- as the site starts getting bigger it may be a good rule of thumb to organize the pages in different sections of the site into seperate folders to maintain the directories. similar to how I have this total reading notes repository set up/

- the root folder contains
  - an index.html - as the homepage for the entire site
  - individual folders for the movies, music, and theater sections of th esite

  - Each sub directory will have
    - index.html for that section
    - any relevant files for that section (CSS, JS, etc...)

## Chapter 15 HTML
- Understanding the differences between printed page layout and web design layout is important.
- Web page has different elements that need to be taken into consideration to make a good looking design layout.
  - Screen size
  - Screen Resolution
  - Page Sizes
  - Fixed Width layouts
  - Liquid layouts
    - These are the foundations of what needs to be considered for design to be able to have a similar viewing experience across different view ports.
- Many developers use grids to help style and design the layout of their pages. This chapter has a lot of depth and I will need to re-visit it 

## Chapter 3 JS
 - Functions are fun
  - They let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task
- Deciding which variables to use, and where, will determine the memory that the variable uses. Global variables use more memory because the computer must remember them through the entire sites durations, which can cause the site to run sluggish
- local variables will only be remembered while the functions(variable) is being called.

## Pair Programming

- Generally involves (2) roles
    - Driver
