## Vocabulary

- Repl.it - code review with if statements and learning about truthy statements
- if statments are just conditional statements - if we include an 'else' or 'else if' statement we will need additonal sttatemetns.

- ! - is a logical not operator - this will always be inverse the value of a variable - will always truty or falsy
 - not distinguising true or false - just whether the value is truty or falsy and reverses the value

 ### Template Literal/ String literal

 - starts with a backtik
 - alert(`goodbye, ${userName} I hope you enjoed my website`);
 - This will turn the whole line into a string - will not need to use escape characters for apostrophes
 
 ## Learning Journal - day 4
 - I've notied it's difficult to routinly take notes, digitally, follow along and still get a lot out of the assignments.
 - I think the concepts are clicking fairly well, at this point but I am not a huge fan of CSS. It seems that it is a lot of tedious work and manipulation for occasionally wacky results... so less is definetly proving to be better.
