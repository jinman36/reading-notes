## Vocabulary

## Introduction Brief
### COC
- to harrass or accept harrassement - full COC on Git hub:) conduct@codefellows.com

- Don't plagerize - never copy and paste code
- add it to your README.md or create a collab.md file

- Self Care
 - ask for help - 15 min rule
 - time managment
 - make a routine, schedule

 ### How to be successful
 - Prepare to fail and let it be part of your process

### Canvas Overview
### Tips for success
- get ready...
- take notes
- keep up with daily assignments
- reseearch topics you don't understand - new or confusing
- be thourough and deliberate when reading error messages and console/terminal responses. Take time and do not go too fast.
- Instructor says all questions are good - I do not agree but they are in charge.
- console.log, console.log, console.log
- self identify areas of growth, revisit class repls, codePens, and labs to cement concepts

 Whta is a repl, compared to a repo

- Zoom etiquette

# Partner Power Hour
1. Who was the speaker and what company or companies were they from? What was the topic of the talk?
- Bob Breitman/ started with GM, now works with PeriCertum - CyberRisk, Security --> during Pandemic
- [PeriCertum Company link](https://www.pericertum.com/solutions/)
2. Share a couple of ways this information will change your approach to your career transisiton
- I do not think this informaiton will change my approach to trasisiton, other than cementing the need to keep security in mind, especially when looking at companies to transisiton into and additonal cerifictions that may create a more competitive candidate for a company.
3. Do you have any other key take aways from the PPH?
- COming from the military where we do online trainign for most things it blows my mind that HIPAA like training not required/standard for the civilian world?
    - 10-15 minutes on common threats to the operational environment, could be so beneficial.
- Beware most freeware - no one looking over the shoulder of the publishers as much as professionally released programs

## Notes from the PPH
- Understanding the risk between using the local network at the office, and using a remote network by having a large workforce working from home.
- The world has gone online, security is even more important and exposed than it ever was before.
- Program from home, help desk support from home, data center - move to this model long term - no overhead for office space, travel, etc.
- some companies were prepared on a small scale but some were comletely flat footed.
- **bad actors** are systematicaly attcking pharamaceticals and many other large businesses (solorwinds, and other mechinisma to get in)

### Vectors

1.  **double extortion** - ransomware - steal all your important data - then hold it hostage
2.  **cyber warfare**  nation state - Korea/ Russia/ other countries - large surge in number and intensity of these types of attacks - nation and companies need to do more to prevent these attacks
3.  **mobile enviroments** - attacking applications in playstore and google store - mobile device management. Corporate apps need to be in encryped apps on phones. threat actors used backdoor through this to a
4.  **Cloud Environments** - workloads are going to cloud environments - Security needs to be built into these systems at the beginning.
        - some of these cloud enviroments are finding bugs in these environments that are being exploited.
- Actions to mitigate
    - Train employees - weakest link (strengthen the weakest link)
    - Understand what the likely attack vectors are (from the 4 above)
    - connect to office environment through a VPN - use encryption
    - Passwords
    - Good anti-virus solutions

- instead of quantifying cyber risk by heatmaps they are being required to use monatary values of lose and risk
- CVE - common vulnerabilites and exploits

## What cyber security solutions every company should deploy

- most companies are exploited through unpatched CVE's
- These are recognized and there are solutions for them, they just remained un corrected.
- Advanced email protections -links, attachments, etc (this could block 95% of attacks through this vector, the other 5% is through training)
- NextGen firewalls - over the counter firewalls ae useless - need sometnhing that identifies all packets that go through / block countries, etc... need business class firewalls
- NextGen and point protection - AntiVirus - signature files- attempts to match signature files of known viruses. looks at bad action malware might make and blocks that action
- Secure cyber operations - all web pages and servers generate logs - (SIEM - security, informaiton, and event management) - companies that do this by themselves tend to fail.
- Third party restoring - suppliers and vendors giving company sensitive items - what is the third party risk - analyze suppliers for thier risk to your network. (example..Target was hacked through a third party point of sales system)
